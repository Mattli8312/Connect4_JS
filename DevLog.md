## Game Features

*1/6/2022* : 

Finished implementing the game logic, and rendering the game board, handling finished states, and the naive minimax algorithms

Current issues: 
    - Minimax algorithm too slow (runtime is exponential, and chrome dev performance is not ideal);
    - Minimax algorithm has problems (scoring system is too discrete leaving areas of guessing by the algorithm)
