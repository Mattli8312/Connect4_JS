# Connect 4 AI

## Introduction

Sold under the name of Milton Bradely in 1974, the game of Connect 4 is an iconic household game that many in the younger generation have grown up with. In this project, I've implemented a simple javascript clone of connect 4 with the main focus of being able to implement an AI algorithm to beat the game of Connect 4. This file will contain documentation for each of the functions and classes I have written for this program along with how to run/install this program for you to tweak and play around with. But mainly, this project was built for a learning experience and is far from production ready :)

## Developement

I've included a DevLog.md file that shows the steps taken to produce everything, top-down, from developing the game logic, to implementing/optimizing various algorithms that can hopefully beat any worthy opponent at the game!

This project is far from over, and I plan on adding numerous features to this web application including socket server interactions and tons of styling. But for now, I'm focusing on the AI side of things as it is the main focus of the project. 

You can access the Devlog File somewhere in the repository to take a better look.

## Languages and frameworks

Although I could have used React or any other framework/library to handle the front-end, I felt this application wasn't necessary for react as it is fairly light weighted. I used simple HTML/CSS for the front end, ES6 for the game logic, and a couple other node modules to handle client-server interactions.
